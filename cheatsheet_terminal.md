# How to use a terminal

Open a Terminal by typing "Terminal" in the Launchpad.

When you are in the Terminal, you are in fact located in a directory, which is initially your home directory. You can change the current directory, create new ones, and do pretty much anything you want in this terminal.

If you have any problem or question about some action in the terminal, don't hesitate to ask Google! For example if you can't copy/paste as usual in the Terminal, search "macos terminal copy paste" and maybe you'll find some tricks like using Ctrl+Shift+C or anything. The terminal is really powerful so the more you learn about it the more powerful you'll be yourself !

## Some useful commands:

* Change the current directory
```
cd
```
Example:
```
# Change the current directory to Downloads
cd Downloads
# Go to the home directory
cd ~
# Go to the parent of the current directory
cd ..
# Move up two levels
cd ../..
```
* Print the current directory
```
pwd
```
* List the files in the current directory
```
ls
```
* Create a directory
```
mkdir
```
Example:
```
# Create a directory named NewDir
mkdir NewDir
```
* Copy a file
```
cp
```
Example:
```
# Copy the file "source" to the file "destination"
cp source destination
```
* Remove a file
```
rm
```
Example:
```
# Remove the file "filename"
rm filename
```
