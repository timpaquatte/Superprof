# How to use a terminal

Open a Terminal by typing "Terminal" in the Launchpad.

When you are in the Terminal, you are in fact located in a directory, which is initially your home directory. You can change the current directory, create new ones, and do pretty much anything you want in this terminal.

Some useful commands:

* Change the current directory
```
cd
```
Example:
```
# Change the current directory to Downloads
cd Downloads
# Go to the home directory
cd ~
# Go to the parent of the current directory
cd ..
# Move up two levels
cd ../..
```
* Print the current directory
```
pwd
```
* List the files in the current directory
```
ls
```
* Create a directory
```
mkdir
```
Example:
```
# Create a directory named NewDir
mkdir NewDir
```
* Copy a file
```
cp
```
Example:
```
# Copy the file "source" to the file "destination"
cp source destination
```
* Remove a file
```
rm
```
Example:
```
# Remove the file "filename"
rm filename
```
